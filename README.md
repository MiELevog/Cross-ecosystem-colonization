# Cross-ecosystem-colonization
This repository contains custom Perl and Bash scripts used for the following paper "Deep-branching Chloroflexota linages illuminate the eco-evolutionary foundation of cross-ecosystem colonization" 
calculate_lengths_annotated.pl: This script reads a multi-FASTA file (nucleotide or amino acid) and calculates the total number of sequences, the mean length of sequences, and the median length of sequences. It requires the BioPerl module Bio::SeqIO to function.
